README: 
the code must writen on a Website that users can find them when they apply. Userers can verify so their application and a admin can check it
so you can check that a application is from the right user and etc

codes must begin with **c** for supporter and **n** for moderator
(everything is working fine) (You can add a role command that assignes the user to a role called "veryfied application" or so but I havent done this)





CODE: 

{dm:{{user}}
